###NOTE:

SWH creates some files, used to load various settings, logs and command history.

Also, SWH has a mode to be compatible with Recovery OS mode.

To view command list, type "help". If you cannot view all commands, type first "more" and then "help"


To update, type "updateswh"

You can also use parameters to run in console, ex:
```

	* "SWH.bat" /c updateswh
	
	* "SWH.bat" /admin
	
	* "SWH.bat" /?
	
	* "SWH.bat" /h"
